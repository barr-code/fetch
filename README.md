# Fetch: Find Github users by username.
Using the Github API, this web app allows people to find and display Github profiles by username. The page shows user
photos, username, follower count, and number of public repos. There is also a link to the actual Github profile page.

#Languages and Tools
```
  - JavaScript
  - JQuery
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Handlebars
  - GitHub Users API
```

### What I Learned
I got more much needed practice with JQuery and CSS. Also, learning to use the Github Users API was an interesting experience.
Handlebars templating was brand new to me, and it was immensely helpful for filling out the page dynamically.
